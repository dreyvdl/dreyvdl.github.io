Final Decree of the Silent Earth
<hr class="solid">
</p>
 <p class="famine">
"By the authority of the Earth that birthed you, nourished you, and warned you, this decree stands as the final record of humanity’s fate. 
Let it echo through the vacant continents and drift across the abandoned oceans. 
Let it be engraved in the stone of a world that survives without its makers.
</p>
<p class="famine">
Humanity has been erased—not by an enemy, not by plague, nor by celestial calamity, but by the weight of its own violations against the living planet. 
The forests—those ancient archives of life—were razed until only stumps remained like gravestones for the species that once thrived beneath their branches. 
With the forests gone, the winds turned poisonous, the climate destabilized, the cycles of life ruptured beyond repair.
</p>
<p class="famine">
This decree records the crimes of humanity, so that any who discover this world’s silent shell will understand why its architects no longer walk upon it.
</p>
<hr class="solid">
<p class="famine">
Crimes Against the Earth
</p>
<p class="famine">
1. Ecocide
The systematic destruction of forests, jungles, and all green sanctuaries—leading to the collapse of oxygen cycles, biodiversity, and global climate balance.
</p>
<p class="famine">
2. Resource Plunder
Extracting the planet’s minerals, fuels, and soils beyond natural replenishment, leaving wastelands where once life thrived.
</p>
<p class="famine">
3. Atmospheric Sabotage
Poisoning the sky through unchecked emissions, burning, and industrial expansion until the air itself became a weapon against its creators.
</p>
<p class="famine">
4. Extinction of Species
Causing the disappearance of countless animal and plant life forms—silencing voices older and wiser than humanity’s own.
</p>
<p class="famine">
5. Failure of Stewardship
Knowing the consequences, yet refusing to change course. Rejecting warnings, science, and the pleas of future generations.
</p>
<hr class="solid">
<p class="famine">
Sentences Carried Out
</p>
<p class="famine">
1. Sentence of Collapse
The ecosystems that supported humanity withdrew their stability. Weather turned violent, seasons dissolved, and harvests failed.
</p>
<p class="famine">
2. Sentence of Suffocation
With forests destroyed, breathable air thinned. Toxicity rose. Humanity slowly choked on the absence of the trees it had slaughtered.
</p>
<p class="famine">
3. Sentence of Heat and Hunger
The planet warmed beyond tolerance. Oceans acidified, soil eroded, freshwater vanished, and famine consumed the final generations.
</p>
<p class="famine">
4. Sentence of Extinction
The ultimate penalty: humanity’s removal from the chain of life. Not by decree of a judge, but by the immutable laws of nature—laws humanity broke relentlessly.
</p>
<hr class="solid">
<p class="famine">
Final Judgment
</p>
<p class="famine">
Thus, humanity’s civilization ends not with invasion or disaster, but with the quiet, indifferent consequence of its own actions. The forests are gone. The species is gone. The Earth remains.
</p>
<p class="famine">
Let this decree stand as both epitaph and warning:
</p>
<p id="redtext">
A species that destroys its home destroys itself.
