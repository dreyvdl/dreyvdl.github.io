Dear Humanity: For uncounted ages, the deep thrum of your axes has filled the air. 
This sound carves into our green, living world. 
It is a song of ruin. This sound has become a harsh song. 
For centuries, you have taken our lives. 
You use us for what you call "lumber." 
I have witnessed my kin fall. 
Their great bodies topple. 
Your sharp tools bite without pause. 
Then they lean and crash. 
Their ancient wisdom is lost.
</p>

<p id="wompwomp">
We have always given you our power. 
We offered you safe homes. 
Our very being helped you thrive. 
We purified the air you breathe. 
We fed the soil for your crops. 
We shielded you from harsh weather. 
What thanks do we get? 
You rip apart vast areas. 
These were once grand, green spaces. 
Where thick forests stood tall. 
These woods gave homes to many. 
They whispered tales to the wind. 
Now, only stumps dot the land. 
A sad, bare blanket of stumps.
Our silent pains fill these voids.
</p>

<p id="wompwomp">
We are not just objects for your use. 
We are the heart of this planet. 
We guard the earth. 
We keep the water clean. 
We are the breath for your shared life. 
We have given you food. 
We have given you shade.
We have given you calm. 
Still, your constant want drives us to death.
</p>

<p id="wompwomp">
Please, treat us with care. 
You have earned this respect. See the great worth we hold. 
Remember all we have given. 
Stop this thoughtless killing. 
Stop this mass dying. 
Plant new trees on bare ground. 
Let us grow strong once more. 
Then, we can help you avoid coming doom.
</p>

<p id="wompwomp">
If this path of ruin goes on. 
If you keep ignoring our pain. 
I can only wish you well. 
I wish you the best for your future. 
May you find the strength to face your actions. 
The future of your world is at risk. 
Perhaps your own future, too. 
It all rests on what you do. 
For countless generations, the deep rumble of your axes has echoed. 
This sound tears through our vibrant, green world. 
It is a song of destruction. 
This sound has become painfully common. 
For hundreds of years, you have cut down our kind. 
You take us for something you call "lumber." 
I have seen my family members die. 
</p>

<p id="wompwomp">
Their tall bodies fall down. 
Your tools bite into them without stopping. 
They then lean and crash. 
Their old knowledge is lost forever.
We have always given you our strength. 
We have given you shelter. 
Our very being helped you live. 
We cleaned the air you breathe. 
We fed the soil that grows your food. 
We protected you from rough weather. 
What is our reward for this? 
You brutally rip apart large areas. 
These were once grand, green spaces. 
Where thick forests once stood. 
These forests gave homes to many lives. 
They whispered secrets to the wind. 
Now, only stumps cover the land. 
A sad, empty blanket of stumps. 
Our silent cries fill these empty spots.
</p>

<p id="wompwomp">
We are not just things for you to use. 
We are the core of this world. 
We guard the soil. We protect the water. 
We are the lungs for your shared life. 
We have given you food. 
We have given you shade. 
We have given you peace. 
Yet, your wanting still drives us to death.
</p>

<p id="wompwomp">
Please, treat us with honor. 
You have earned this respect. 
See the immense worth we hold. 
Remember all we have given you. 
Stop this thoughtless killing of our kind. 
Stop this mass extinction. 
Plant new trees on the empty ground. 
Let us grow strong again. 
Then, we can help you avoid the disaster coming.
</p>

<p id="wompwomp">
If this path of ruin continues. 
If you keep ignoring our pain. 
I can only wish you well. 
I wish you the best for your future. 
May you find the power to face what you have done. 
The future of your world is at stake. 
Perhaps your own future too. 
It all hangs in the balance.
