    <p>About our group: Our group, “The Woodies”, advocates for limited deforestation and more responsible management of resources granted by trees and plants. Our group came to be in 2001 when a group of historical scholars, me included, discussed things like ancient Athenian ship-building and logistical capabilities of nations with varying numbers of trees. We found out that the damage people throughout history would be catastrophic in the future, maybe even in the present. We formed The Woodies to stop mass-deforestation as much and as soon as possible. We also advocate for continual tree-planting and help victims of deforestation-related natural disasters. We currently operate in La Marque Street, Saint Denis. </p>
